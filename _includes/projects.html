          Bioinformatic Analysis Pipeline for Somatic Mutations in Cancer
        </h4>
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            BALSAMIC is a Clinical Genomics Core Facility effort aimed at facilitating the
            identification of somatic mutations and the interpretation of large-scale DNA sequencing
            data in cancer patients, paving the way for improved diagnostics, care, and treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a Snakemake-based configurable bioinformatics pipeline that integrates multiple
            somatic variant-calling algorithms to detect SNVs, InDels, CNVs, and SVs. BALSAMIC
            supports whole-genome, whole-exome, and targeted gene sequencing, enabling the
            processing of tumor-only and tumor-normal sample pairs, as well as assays with unique
            molecular identifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am contributing to its development, maintenance, automation, and integration within
            the group's infrastructure, as well as in addressing clinical visualisation and
            interpretation needs.

          Bioinformatics Pipeline for the Detection of Somatic Mutations in Liquid Biopsy Samples
          from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
        </h4>
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            As part of my master's thesis project, I developed a somatic variant filtering pipeline
            and a user-friendly graphical interface with the goal of automating the manual curation
            of next-generation sequencing data conducted by clinicians and researchers at Puerta de
            Hierro University Hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project involved integrating experimental and computational methodologies to
            identify resistance mutations, provide guidance for clinical treatment decisions, and
            improve understanding of the screening and diagnostic capabilities of liquid biopsies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the results and methodologies obtained led to the publication of an article, and
            currently, the developed algorithm is extensively used in clinical practice.

            OnkoPROs is an interoperable web, mobile, and server platform created to assist health
            professionals at the San Sebasti√°n Oncology Hospital in tailoring treatment plans and
            remotely monitoring cancer patients undergoing rehabilitation, thus minimizing their
            frequent visits to the hospital for routine check-ups.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform includes a web application for clinicians to design and gather
            patient-reported outcomes (PROs), as well as a mobile application for patients. Through
            the mobile app, patients can complete questionnaires, report their health status,
            communicate with their doctors, and receive the results of their clinical evaluations.
          </p>
          <p>
            OnkoPROs was developed using Angular and NativeScript for the frontend, and Nginx and
            JavaScript for the backend, connecting to the medical record database of the hospital.

          <p>
            FERehab originated from my bachelor's final project with the aim of enhancing the
            functional, emotional, cognitive, and social abilities of children with Autism Spectrum
            Disorder (ASD) and elderly individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD).
          </p>
          <p>
            It features an AI and computer vision-based real-time facial expression recognition
            model, along with an interactive game for patients, all integrated into a Raspberry Pi
            smart mirror. Currently, it's in the proof-of-concept phase at the Smart House Living
            Lab of the Technical University of Madrid.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the technical side, the machine learning model has been designed using a
            Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
            to expand the training dataset, and transfer learning methods.

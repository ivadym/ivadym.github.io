          Platform for the Management and Follow-Up of Oncological Patients
        </div>
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            OnkoPROs is an interoperable web, mobile, and server platform created to assist health
            professionals at the San Sebasti√°n Oncology Hospital in tailoring treatment plans and
            remotely monitoring cancer patients undergoing rehabilitation, thus minimizing their
            frequent visits to the hospital for routine check-ups.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform includes a web application for clinicians to design and gather
            patient-reported outcomes (PROs), as well as a mobile application for patients. Through
            the mobile app, patients can complete questionnaires, report their health status,
            communicate with their doctors, and receive the results of their clinical evaluations.
          </p>
          <p>
            OnkoPROs was developed using Angular and NativeScript for the frontend, and Nginx and
            JavaScript for the backend, connecting to the medical record database of the hospital.

          Facial Expression Recognition Machine Learning Model for Multifaceted Rehabilitation
        </div>
        <div class="project-description">
          <p>
            FE-REHAB originated from my bachelor's final project with the aim of enhancing the
            functional, emotional, cognitive, and social abilities of children with Autism Spectrum
            Disorder (ASD) and elderly individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD).
          </p>
          <p>
            It features an AI and computer vision-based real-time facial expression recognition
            model, along with an interactive game for patients, all integrated into a Raspberry Pi
            smart mirror. Currently, it's in the proof-of-concept phase at the Smart House Living
            Lab of the Technical University of Madrid.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the technical side, the machine learning model has been designed using a
            Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
            to expand the training dataset, and transfer learning techniques.
